### User Story
AS A traveler
I **WANT** to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

**GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs**
>  WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

> WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

> WHEN I view the UV index THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

> WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
